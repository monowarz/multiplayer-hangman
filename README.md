# Multiplayer Hangman Game üéÆüêç

## Overview
This project is a Multiplayer Hangman game developed in Python. The game allows two players to take turns guessing letters to uncover a hidden word. Each player has a maximum of six incorrect guesses, with hints provided to guide them. Incorrect guesses are visually represented by different stages of a hangman figure. The objective is for a player to correctly guess the word before running out of attempts.

## Key Features
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Two players alternate turns guessing letters.
- **Hint System**: Hints are provided using a dictionary to assist with guesses.
- **Visual Feedback**: Incorrect guesses are displayed by stages of a hangman figure.

## Gameplay Instructions
1. Players take turns guessing one lowercase letter at a time. Multiple letters or capital letters are not accepted.
2. If a letter appears multiple times in the word, guessing it once will reveal all instances.
3. Each player has up to 6 incorrect guesses.
4. If one player runs out of attempts, the other player continues until they either win or also run out of attempts.
5. **Winning Terms**: The first player to guess the word correctly wins. If both players run out of guesses without solving the word, it‚Äôs a draw.
